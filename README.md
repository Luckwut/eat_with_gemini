**Eat with Gemini** is a Flutter app that leverages the power of the [**Google Gemini LLM**](https://ai.google.dev/) to redefine how users interact with food and nutrition. By combining advanced AI with user-friendly features, this app provides a seamless experience for users to analyze, understand, and optimize their dietary choices.

## Features

### ðŸ“¸ Scan & Analyze

- **Recipe Creator**  
  Upload an image of ingredients, and the app generates a recipe tailored to the items identified.
- **Dish Deconstructor**  
  Analyze dishes, foods, drinks, or other consumables from an image. The AI will create a recipe on how to make those items.
- **Suitability Analyzer**  
  Understand if a particular dish is suitable for you. The app considers nutritional value, health benefits, and dietary restrictions.

### ðŸŒŸ Personalized User Preferences

- **Dietary Preferences**  
  Users can specify their dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, keto, gluten-free) for customized recipe recommendations.
- **Health Considerations**  
  Take health factors into account, such as allergies or medical conditions, to ensure the AI provides the most relevant advice.
